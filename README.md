# Brian's Toggl-Pomodoro



### Why?
---

Toggl currently has some limitations.

Pomodoro:
    - Can't extend / pause timer.
    - Cant' choose different sounds
Toggl's Time Entries:
    - Can't choose any sort of auditory feedback (like white/pink noise)


---

### Implementation
---

I am simply using Python to call Toggl's REST API.



#### How to use:

1) Paste your Toggl API key in config.json
2) ???
3) Profit!
